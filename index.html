	<p>P-SOCRATES (<b>Parallel Software Framework for Time-Critical Many-core Systems</b>) was an European project which intended to allow current and future applications with high-performance and real-time requirements to fully exploit the huge performance opportunities brought by the most advanced many-core processors, whilst ensuring a predictable performance and maintaining (or even reducing) development costs of applications. </p>
	
	<p><b>The purpose of P-SOCRATES was to develop an entirely new design framework, from the conceptual design of the system functionality to its physical implementation, to facilitate the deployment of standardized parallel architectures in all kinds of systems.</b></p>
