<p >P-SOCRATES (Parallel Software Framework for Time-Critical
Many-core Systems) was a European project intended to allow current and future
applications with high-performance and real-time requirements to fully exploit
the huge performance opportunities brought by the most advanced many-core
processors, whilst ensuring a predictable performance and maintaining (or even
reducing) development costs of applications. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p >The purpose of P-SOCRATES was to develop an entirely new
design framework, from the conceptual design of the system functionality to its
physical implementation, to facilitate the deployment of standardized parallel
architectures in all kinds of systems. This framework was released under the
brand of <a href="https://upscale-sdk.github.io/">UpScale SDK</a>.</p>

<P>The SDK  includes the following components:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Source  to source compiler – enabling to analyze source code OpenMP 
  parallelism  annotations, extracting the required information to allow for 
  efficient and predictable  mapping and scheduling of parallel 
  computations.</LI>
  <LI>Lightweight  OpenMP tasking runtime – a small-footprint implementation of 
  the tasking model  of the latest OpenMP specification, which uses the 
  information extracted by the  compiler to map OpenMP tasks to operating 
  systems threads.&nbsp; </LI>
  <LI>Embedded  Many-Core Operating System – a small kernel implementation which 
  efficiently  handles parallel threads in manycore platforms, supporting both 
  static  assignment of threads to cores as well as global scheduling 
  approaches. </LI>
  <LI>Analysis  tools – an integrated toolset for the timing and schedulability 
  analysis of  real-time parallel applications. </LI></UL>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p >The scientific and technical work done in the P-SOCRATES
project was published in the open access book “<a
href="https://www.riverpublishers.com/research_details.php?book_id=507">High-Performance
and Time-Predictable Embedded Computing</a>”.</p>

<p >The topics discussed in the book include: </p>

<ul>
<li>Parallel embedded platforms</li>
<li>Programming models</li>

<li>Mapping and scheduling of parallel computations</li>

<li>Timing and schedulability analysis</li>

<li>Runtimes and operating systems</li>
</ul>

  <P>The P-SOCRATES project was developed by a consortium  led by  Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Portugal, with partners 
  Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, Spain, University of Modena 
and Regio Emilia,  Italy, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 
Switzerland, Evidence SRL,  Italy, Active Technologies SRL, Italy and ATOS,
